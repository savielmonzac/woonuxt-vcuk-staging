All you need to do is contact us via email at jess@vagcruisers.uk .

            VAGCRUISERSUK do not accept any liability for lost or damaged parcels in the post. When returning an item to ourselves, we request that you obtain proof of postage.  You reserve the right to ask you post officer for a receipt of postage. This can be sent to ourselves as proof of postage. If a parcel is lost in transit on its way back to us, we will require a proof of purchase receipt to complete your refund. As mentioned above, we will not reimburse any postage costs (unless an item is faulty)

We use exactly what is submitted to ourselves so make sure grammar, punctuation, spelling and spacing of words are correct.

If the order has already been processed and made, unfortunately we cannot make any amendments. 

            If an error has been made by us in production of personalised item(s), we will offer a refund or replacement for the items. Any request for returns or replacements due to error need to be sent to jess@vagcruisers.uk . Please include: full name, email address, time/date of purchase, postage address, order number, order details, fault details and fault images. The incorrect item will need to be sent back to us, in this case shipping will be reimbursed. Returned items need to be unused and in their original condition and packaging.

            Here at VAGCRUISERSUK we ensure all dispatched items are of high standards. We understand that unfortunately items can arrive damaged or faulty due to situations beyond our control.

You will be informed once your refund has been processed and it should be returned to your original payment method within 5 to 10 business days. We are unable to offer any refunds until the items are back with ourselves. When an item is received by a member of the VAGCRUISERSUK shipping team, the item will be inspected to ensure it has been returned in the requested condition.
